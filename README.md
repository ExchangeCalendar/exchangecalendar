## Introduction

Exchange Calendar is an add-on for [Thunderbird](https://mozilla.org/thunderbird)
and [Seamonkey](https://www.seamonkey-project.org/).

It extends the [Lightning](https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/lightning/) add-on to provide
[Microsoft Exchange](http://microsoft.com/exchange) support.

Exchange Calendar extension can:
  * Synchronize calendars, tasks, and contacts with a Microsoft Exchange server.
  * Create, edit and update events and tasks.
  * Display contacts from your address books and the global address list
    (they are only readable, they are usable with address autocompletion).
  * Manage the Exchange « out of office » feature.

This extension requires:
  * A recent Thunderbird version up to 59.
  * Lightning extension corresponding to the Thunderbird release.
  * The Exchange server has to provide an Exchange Web Service.

This extension was developed by its original author (Michel Verbraak) for
Exchange 2007, 2010 and 2013.

The ExchangeCalendar community is now maintaining this extension. Support is
best effort and cannot be guaranteed. Contributions are welcome.

## Contributing

This add-on is open source and based on the work of many
[contributors](https://github.com/ExchangeCalendar/exchangecalendar/graphs/contributors).

This project is a community driven effort to develop and maintain the
"Exchange EWS Provider" extension originally created by Michel Verbraak.

### Provide feedback, report issue

You are welcome to provide feedback on our Github project:
https://github.com/ExchangeCalendar/exchangecalendar

Please note that the project is built only for latest stable Thunderbird release
and latest stable Lightning release.

The more information you can provide about an issue, the easier it becomes to
reproduce and fix. Examples of helpful informations are:
  * Thunderbird version
  * Lightning version
  * Active Thunderbird add-ons
  * Log output

### Get project and build it

To build the add-on, you have to:
```bash
# clone this project
git clone https://github.com/ExchangeCalendar/exchangecalendar.git
cd exchangecalendar
# build it
make build
```
Then an `xpi` file is created in the project folder.
This file is directly installable from the add-on page of Thunderbird.

If it doesn't work, please check you have these tools installed (example for
Debian):
```bash
sudo apt install git-core zip
```

### Patch the code

To help us to maintain the code, we will be thankful to follow these main
guidelines:

* Use indentation with 4 spaces
* Avoid too long lines, try to break long lines into smaller ones
* Avoid to write "spaghetti" code with too many if/else imbrications
* Try to keep code simple to help us maintain it on long term

Note that our `Makefile` has a `beautify` target which will try to beautify
all JavaScript (requires `jsbeautifier` Debian package) and XML code
(requires `tidy` package) to help maintain a clean code.

When your patches are ready, you are welcome to do pull requests on our
repository.

Please help us to review your code by making multiple small pull
requests instead of big ones modifying big parts of the code.

#### Building component interface files

Whenever an `.idl` file is changed, it is necessary to regenerate the
corresponding binary `.xpt` interface file. To
do this, download and extract the 
[Gecko SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Guide/Creating_components/Setting_up_the_Gecko_SDK).
Next, go to the SDK's `idl` folder and run `python ../sdk/bin/typelib.py 
-o $FILE.xpt $FILE.idl` to generate the binary interface file (replace 
`$FILE` with the full path to an actual file). This SDK tool called 
`pyxpidl` is documented 
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/XPIDL/pyxpidl).
